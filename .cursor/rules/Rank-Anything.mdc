# Rank-Anything Web Application

## Project Overview
Rank-Anything is a web application that enables users to rate and review items organized in a two-level structure: topics and objects. Users can create custom topics, add objects within those topics, and assign tags to objects for easy categorization. Ratings are on a 1-to-5-star scale with optional text reviews. The app provides a simple, user-friendly interface for browsing, adding, and rating content.

## Functional Requirements
- **Topic Management**:
  - Users can view a list of all topics on the homepage.
  - Users can add new topics with a name (e.g., "Peking University Cafeteria Dishes").
- **Object Management**:
  - Within a topic, users can view a list of objects.
  - Users can add objects to a topic, specifying a name (e.g., "Shaoyuan Cafeteria Yellow Braised Chicken") and tags (e.g., "Peking University," "Cafeteria," "Shaoyuan," "Yellow Braised Chicken," "Mildly Spicy," "Chicken").
- **Rating and Reviewing**:
  - Users can select an object to rate it on a 1-to-5-star scale and optionally add a text review.
  - Ratings and reviews are stored and displayed for each object.
- **Navigation**:
  - Homepage shows all topics.
  - Clicking a topic shows its objects.
  - Clicking an object allows rating and viewing details.
- **Tagging System**:
  - Users can assign multiple tags to objects for categorization and filtering.
- **Data Persistence**:
  - All topics, objects, tags, ratings, and reviews are saved locally in the browser.

## User Interface
